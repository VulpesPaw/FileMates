# FileMates - Find the File-mate of you files
## Common Usage
The common usage will be to find and move corresponding files parrallell to others. \
For a photagrother it would mean, if you seperate jpgs and raw files, you'd sort out the jpgs on thier own, \
and afterwards starts FileMates to get the corresponding based on the file names (not exctentions) finds the raw files\
and move them to another folder or directory with or withour the inital jpg files
